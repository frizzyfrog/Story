I started the online course for Web Development. Its been a rough 2 months, but I am trying to persevere. I hope to learn and understand the best I can.
I refuse to be jobless. 

My anxiety hasn't been a friend to me, but the noises are a bit of comfort. I hate complete silence. I prefer to hear something. Anything.
